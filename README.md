## 1. Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common life-threatening diseases among women worldwide. Early diagnosis significantly improves treatment outcomes. Ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive and cost-effective modality and is especially suitable for dense breast tissue.

This project implements an automated deep learning–based system to classify breast ultrasound images into three categories: normal, benign, and malignant. Multiple convolutional neural network architectures and transfer learning approaches are explored and compared to analyze performance, robustness, and clinical relevance.

## 2. Related Work

Recent research in medical image analysis has demonstrated the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks for ultrasound image classification. Transfer learning using ImageNet-pretrained models such as ResNet and AlexNet is commonly applied to overcome limited dataset size and improve feature representation.

The Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUSI) has been widely used in prior studies for automated breast lesion classification and provides both image-level labels and lesion masks.

## 3. Dataset

The project uses the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUSI), which consists of ultrasound images grouped into three classes:
- Normal                        Benign                                Malignant
 <img width="268" height="170" alt="normal (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d32be2ba-d8ae-4443-8bd4-ee6098db2ab0" />  <img width="268" height="170" alt="benign (2)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb1c71f6-f862-48fc-b864-d24f383d0508" />  <img width="268" height="170" alt="malignant (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b81889cf-1e30-473a-99aa-44c8faa309db" />

**Dataset Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sabahesaraki/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset](url)

**Dataset Statistics:**

| Class      | Number of Images | Percentage |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Normal     | 133            | 17%       |
| Benign     | 437            | 56%       |
| Malignant  | 210            | 27%       |
| Total      | 780            | 100%      |

- Image resolution: 500 × 500 pixels


For benign and malignant cases, corresponding ground-truth lesion masks are available. These masks are used in one experimental setup to generate overlay images that emphasize lesion regions.

## 4. Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is handled through scripts located in the `tools/` directory.

The preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Automated dataset download
- Image resizing to 224 × 224
- RGB conversion
- Label extraction from directory structure
- Generation of an overlay dataset using lesion masks:
  - Background regions are darkened (80% reduction) for benign and malignant images
  - Normal images remain unchanged

### Model Architectures

Five model configurations were implemented and evaluated:

| Experiment | Model | Data | Key Features |
|------------|-------|------|--------------|
| 1 | Custom CNN | Original | Class weights, balanced sampler, 75 epochs |
| 2 | ResNet50 | Original | Transfer learning, frozen backbone |
| 3 | Custom CNN | Overlay (masked) | Hyperparameter-optimized, 75 epochs |
| 4 | Custom CNN | Original | Adam optimizer, no class weights, 35 epochs |
| 5 | AlexNet | Original | Transfer learning, frozen features, 20 epochs |

**Custom CNN Architecture:**
- 4 convolutional blocks (32 → 64 → 128 → 256 filters)
- BatchNorm + ReLU after each convolution
- MaxPooling after each block
- AdaptiveAvgPool2d to 7×7
- Classifier: 3 linear layers with Dropout(0.4)

### Training Strategy

All models are trained using supervised learning with cross-entropy loss.

Training configuration includes:
- **Optimizers**: SGD (with momentum) and AdamW
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Cosine annealing with warm-up (5 epochs)
- **Batch size**: 32 (variable in HPO experiments)
- **Class imbalance handling**: WeightedRandomSampler + weighted CrossEntropyLoss
- **Hardware**: GPU acceleration when available

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Precision
- Recall (Sensitivity)
- F1-Score
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix

Malignant detection is additionally treated as a binary classification task with threshold tuning to achieve ≥95% recall, reflecting clinical screening priorities.

---

## 6. Results and Discussion

All models are evaluated on a held-out test set using consistent evaluation metrics.

### Key Results

| Model | Malignant Recall | Malignant Precision | Accuracy | Balanced Accuracy |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Custom CNN + Overlay (Exp 3) | **94%** | 84% | 94% | 95% |
| Custom CNN (Exp 1) | **94%** | 84% | 87% | 95% |
| Custom CNN + Adam (Exp 4) | 91% | 88% | 82% | 88% |
| AlexNet (Exp 5) | 88% | 85% | 79% | 86% |
| ResNet50 (Exp 2) | 64% | 70% | 74% | 72% |

**Best Model Performance (Custom CNN + Overlay):**
- Malignant: 94% recall, 84% precision, F1-score 0.89
- Benign: 97% precision, 92% recall
- Normal: 100% precision, 100% recall

Visual results include:
- Training and validation loss curves
- Training and validation accuracy curves
- Confusion matrices

## 9. Limitations and Future Work

The project is limited by dataset size and lack of external validation. Classification is performed independently from segmentation.

Future work may include attention-based models, vision transformers, multi-task learning, and clinical decision threshold calibration.
